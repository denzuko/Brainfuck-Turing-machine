need ir beam sensor "1.3mm" (8x)
need prism / mirror to direct single 1.8mm beam to all eight sensors
need one geared brushless dc motor (3.3v) amps tba
need ftdi
need system assembly + driver
need tape and punch

Design: 

 latch switch { replace with rs232 software handshake xon/xoff }
   | (via reset)
   v
  555 -> Power MOSFET+.01uF ceramic cap -> dc motor
   |
   --------------------------|
                             v
IR Sensor array input -> SN74ALS166N -> max232


follows ecma-10 standards where able
   - data set is binary (bf operators) or values (numeric)
   - we use *brainfuck (ie pointer brainfuck)


look into TTL brainfuck cpu, 555 timer dc motor



End goal:

    * plugable device that's programable by punch tape, accessories could be "wifi", "display", "music" (pezio-electric), "storage", and/or rs232 or gpio output
    * Teach about Turing machines while enabling artests and makers to create
    * Videos for instructions (artistic focused but with a little technical thrown in)
    * kits for edu centers, hobists, artests, and makers

wintergardin - tape



Consept:
   cards/tapes ran pass ir sensors are driven down to usb
